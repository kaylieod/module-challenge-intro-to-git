## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub stores git on a remote server, while git is the version contrl system itself.
3. Why do we create a branch? A branch is created when you don't want to commit changes to the main.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request allows you to review differences between branches.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. You would use git checkout -b main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch downloads things into your local repo from a remote repo. Git merge allows you to take code from the branch and integrate it into one. Git pull updates the local repo from the remote repo.
7. What is a merge conflict? This occurs when the merging branches have competing commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You decide which change to incorporate in the final merge.
